# Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks-Hyperparameter-tuning-Regularization-and-Optimization
## Week 1 / Initialization:-
The assignment allows to:-

- Understand the different initialization methods and their impact on our model performance

- Implement zero initialization and and see it fails to "break symmetry",

- Recognize that random initialization "breaks symmetry" and yields more efficient models,

- Understand that we could use both random initialization and scaling to get even better training performance on your model.

## Week 1 / Regularization:-

The assignment allows to:-

- Understand that different regularization methods that could help our model.

- Implement dropout and see it work on data.

- Recognize that a model without regularization gives us a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.

- Understand that we could use both dropout and regularization on our model.
