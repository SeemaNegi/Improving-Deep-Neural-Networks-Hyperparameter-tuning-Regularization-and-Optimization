## Week 1 / Initialization:-
The assignment allows to:-

- Understand the different initialization methods and their impact on our model performance

- Implement zero initialization and and see it fails to "break symmetry",

- Recognize that random initialization "breaks symmetry" and yields more efficient models,

- Understand that we could use both random initialization and scaling to get even better training performance on your model.
